# Emilia Syntax Theme

This theme is inspired by the Re:Zero character, [Emilia](https://myanimelist.net/character/118737/Emilia).

This theme is mainly optimized for JS but looks great (in my opinion) with other languages.

## Installation
On your console:

```
apm install hotaru-syntax
```

or install via Atom's settings install tab.

This theme works great when paired with a dynamic UI theme like [Kecleon UI](https://github.com/arturoalviar/atom-kecleon-ui) (I made that UI theme).

```
apm install kecleon-ui
```
